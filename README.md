# K-Means-Cluster-Analysis_ShinyApp
This is a Shiny app that can be useful for those who want to test and obtain quick results on k-means clusters for their data. The user may test different values of k=2 to 20, and can also obtain a graphic visualization of the optimal number of clusters. A heatmap of clusters of individual observations and variables used will be visible as well. 

A distance matrix graph will be also ploted and will be updated when the variables used are modified in a dropdown menu on the side bar menu.

Enjoy!
